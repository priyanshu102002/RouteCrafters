# React Routing with Tech Stack

I recently learned about React Routing from a website that features a multipage website example. This project allowed me to explore the capabilities of React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS. One of the pages on this website involved calling the GitHub API and displaying specific information on the site. In particular, I implemented a feature that shows the user's profile picture, username, and follower count from GitHub.

## Tech Stack Used

Here's the tech stack I used for this project:

- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It served as the foundation for creating dynamic and interactive components in my application.

- **React Router**: React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. It allowed me to implement multipage navigation seamlessly.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that made styling and designing the user interface of my React application both efficient and responsive.

## Learning React Routing

React Routing is a crucial aspect of building single-page applications (SPAs) in React. It allows us to navigate between different views or components within our application without the need for a full page refresh. This results in a smoother and more seamless user experience.

### Key Concepts

Here are some key concepts I learned while working with React Routing:

- **Route Configuration**: Defining the routes for various views or components in our application using the `react-router-dom` library.

- **Route Rendering**: Understanding how to render different components based on the current URL using `Route` and `Switch` components.

- **Navigation**: Implementing navigation between routes using `Link` or `NavLink` components.

- **Route Parameters**: Passing and accessing parameters in the URL to display dynamic content.

## GitHub API Integration

One of the practical exercises I completed involved integrating the GitHub API into my React application. Here's what I did:

1. **API Request**: I made a GET request to the GitHub API to fetch user data, including the profile picture, username, and follower count.

2. **Displaying Data**: I displayed the fetched data on a specific page within my React application. This page allowed users to see the GitHub user's information.

3. **Dynamic Routing**: I used dynamic routing to display the GitHub user's information on different pages based on the username provided in the URL.

## Conclusion

React, React Router, and Tailwind CSS form a powerful combination for building modern web applications. React Routing enhances the user experience by enabling seamless navigation between different parts of the application, while Tailwind CSS simplifies the styling process, making the application visually appealing and responsive.

The integration of the GitHub API added a practical and real-world dimension to my learning experience, allowing me to display external data in my React application.

Overall, my experience with this tech stack and the project was both educational and rewarding, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
